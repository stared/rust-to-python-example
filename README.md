# Rust to Python using PyO3 - an example

An example directly taken from the [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) README. It has some [examples in a dedicated folder](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/tree/main/examples), but all of these are slightly bigger. And here is a superminimal one.

The only change is that it is a runable example (unlike Markdown) + with GitHub Actions to show all required commands in an explicit (and testable) way.
